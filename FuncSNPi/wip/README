There have been substantial changes to the layout and function of this script
start command with -h option to see how to set up a run. That information
has been copied here:
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS FOR FuncSNPi:
                -c : max cpus availible (ex. -c 8)
                -g : genome build to use (ex. -g hg19)
                -r : location of risk SNP file (ex. -r ~/riskSNP.txt)
                -b : location of of biological peaks file, in bed format (ex. -b ~/biopeaks.bed)

                riskSNP file must be in the following tab deliminated format
                <region>                <risk SNP id>   <ethnic group>
                10:122837334-123837335  rs2981579       EUR             <- example

IMPORTANT:::
to kill the file when it is running in parallel, find the PID by running
ps aux | grep <username> | grep <name of script>
and then run
kill <PID>
If you just kill the subroutines that we call like java etc, the program will continue running.
I will post an issue for this
